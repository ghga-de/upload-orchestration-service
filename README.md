# Microservice Repository Template

This is a template for GitHub repositories containing one Python-based microservice (optimal for a multirepository setup).

It features:

- *Continuous Templation* - A continuous update-delivery mechanism for templated repositories
- A [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/)-based fully-configured development environment for vscode
- Tight linting and formatting using [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
- Static type checking using [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/)
- Security scanning using [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- A structure for automated tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/)
- Dependency locking using [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)
- Git hooks checking linting and formatting before committing using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Automatic container-building and publishing to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- GitHub Actions for automating or checking all of the above

It is worth emphasizing the first point, this template is not just a one-time kickstart for your project
but repositories created using this template will continue receiving updates as the template evolves.
For further details, please look at the explanation in [.template/README.md](/.template/README.md).

Please also refer to [.readme_generation/README.md](/.readme_generation/README.md) for details on how
to adapt this readme.

Here the intro to the template stops and the actual template for the readme of the microservice starts:

# My Microservice

My-Microservice - a short description

## Description

<!-- Please provide a short overview of the features of this service. -->

Here you should provide a short summary of the purpose of this microservice.


## Installation

We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-built version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/my-microservice):
```bash
docker pull ghga/my-microservice:0.1.0
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/my-microservice:0.1.0 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/my-microservice:0.1.0 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
my_microservice --help
```

## Configuration

### Usage:

A template YAML for configuring the service can be found at
[`./example_config.yaml`](./example_config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.my_microservice.yaml`, and place it in one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory where you execute the service (on Linux: `./.my_microservice.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on Linux: `~/.my_microservice.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example_config.yaml`](./example_config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `my_microservice_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `my_microservice_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To use file secrets, please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.

## HTTP API
An OpenAPI specification for this service can be found [here](./openapi.yaml).

## Architecture and Design:
<!-- Please provide an overview of the architecture and design of the code base.
Mention anything that deviates from the standard Triple Hexagonal Architecture and
the corresponding structure. -->

This is a Python-based service following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern.
It uses protocol/provider pairs and dependency injection mechanisms provided by the
[hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.


## Development

For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of VS Code
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as VS Code with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in VS Code and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the VS Code "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant VS Code extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a command `dev_install` is available for convenience.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, and it installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) or the
[`lock/requirements-dev.txt`](./lock/requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
